## Deploying a simple application to an Openshift Cluster
The folder simple-nodejs-app contains a nodejs application based on express.js framework.
When deployed, the API of the application would be available on those two endpoints :
 - /home
 - /login

Deploy the simple nodejs application on an openshift cluster :

```shell
$ oc new-app --as-deployment-config --name simple https://github.com/fouscou/openshift-tutorials.git#main --context-dir simple-node-app
```

Check that there is a new deployment created :

```shell
$ oc status
```

Follow the build configuration log :

```shell
$ oc logs -f bc/simple 
```

Check the status of the pods :

```shell
$ oc get pod
```

Expose the application to access it outside of the cluster :

```shell
$ oc expose svc/simple
```

Get the host of the route :

```shell
$ oc get route
```

Check the API endpoint of the deployed application
```shell
$ API_ENDPOINT=$(oc get route simple -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}')
$ curl $API_ENDPOINT/home
$ curl $API_ENDPOINT/login
```
